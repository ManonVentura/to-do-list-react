# TO-DO LIST PROJECT

The goal of this project was to discover Cypress. And get more and more confortable with React JS and styled-components

## To start the project

### `yarn start` will open http://localhost:3000/

The current version of the project is in no way perfect and is just a fun project to work on.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you have some feedback on ways to improve my coding.

See you
